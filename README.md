# Phosphor Angular Loader

## Introduction

This loader was built to facilitate creating JupyterLab extensions while making use of the Angular framework. 

To begin using this tool you will need to be familiar with building extensions for JupyterLab. A good tutorial
to get yourself started is the following:

http://jupyterlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xkcd_extension_tutorial.html


## Examples

### Plain phosphor example

A raw example built just within phosphor (not as a jupyterlab extension) is provided within the [example](example/) directory.

### Jupyterlab extension example

The @simonbiggs/jupyterlab-form extension makes use of this package. The [source code](https://github.com/SimonBiggs/jupyterlab-form)
for that extension can provide a more extensive example of using this package for building jupyterlab extensions.
