# Phosphor Angular Loader

## Introduction

This loader was built to facilitate creating JupyterLab extensions while making use of the Angular framework. 

If you just want to make a JupyterLab extension and don't know too much about Angular you might be in slightly the wrong place. I recommend instead you head on over to the JupyterLab extension tutorial:

> http://jupyterlab-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xkcd_extension_tutorial.html

If you are comfortable with Angular but want to learn how to make a JupyterLab extension the above extension is also a good place to start. Go there first, then come back here and browse the examples.

The target audience for this tool is those who are already comfortable creating Angular Apps (https://angular.io/). I don't recommended attempting to use this tool unless you are confident with Angular.

## Examples

### Plain phosphor example

A raw example built just within phosphor (not as a jupyterlab extension) is provided within the [example](example/) directory.

### Jupyterlab extension example

The [@simonbiggs/jupyterlab-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@simonbiggs/jupyterlab-form) extension makes use of this package. The [source code](https://github.com/SimonBiggs/jupyterlab-form) for that extension can provide a more extensive example of using this package for building jupyterlab extensions.
